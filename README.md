codeCount is a command-line tool that helps you count the lines of code and characters in a coding project. This tool supports various programming languages and provides a quick overview of your project's codebase statistics.

## Installation

1. Download the `codeCount` executable from the provided source. [Download Link](https://github.com/AdityaMotale/code_count/blob/main/release/codeCount.exe)

2. Place the executable in a directory of your choice. You can either use an existing directory in your system's PATH or create a new one to store your development tools. For example, you could create a directory named "DevTools" in your user directory (C:\Users\YourUsername\DevTools).

3. Add the directory containing the `codeCount` executable to your system's PATH environment variable. This enables you to run the `codeCount` command from any directory in the command prompt.

- Search for "Environment Variables" in the Start menu and click on "Edit the system environment variables."
- Click the "Environment Variables" button.
- In the "System Variables" section, find and select the "Path" variable, then click "Edit."
- Click "New" and add the path to the directory containing the `codeCount` executable. For example, if you placed the executable in "C:\Users\YourUsername\DevTools", add "C:\Users\YourUsername\DevTools" to the PATH.

## Usage

Open a new terminal/command prompt window and use the following syntax to count lines of code and characters in a coding project:

```bash
# Syntax: codeCount path-to-project
codeCount /path/to/your/project

# Example: Count lines and characters in a project named "my_project"
codeCount C:\Users\YourUsername\projects\my_project
```
